// Package httpmiddleware holds HTTP middleware shared across arcade services.
// It exists because in microservice deployments each service (api-server,
// sse, …) runs in its own pod with its own http.Server, so per-service
// middleware copies would drift out of sync.
package httpmiddleware

import "net/http"

// WithCORS wraps an http.Handler so every response carries CORS headers and
// OPTIONS preflight requests are answered directly with 204 — without ever
// reaching gin's router. This matters because gin only registers concrete
// (method, path) pairs: a browser's `OPTIONS /tx` preflight would otherwise
// 404 when only `POST /tx` is declared, and the middleware would never run.
//
// Arcade exposes a public broadcast/status API reached from browser-based
// wallets and explorers across many origins, so the default policy is "allow
// any origin" with no credentials. The wildcard origin is safe here because
// auth is Bearer-token based; it cannot be combined with
// Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, which we don't need.
//
// The SSE service uses the same wrapper. In microservice deployments
// (mode=sse) the SSE pod serves /events on its own HTTP listener, so the
// api-server's CORS handling isn't in the request path; wrapping the SSE
// router here is what lets EventSource clients from third-party origins
// connect at all.
